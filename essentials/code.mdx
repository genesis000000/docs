Whatever algorithm we use takes into account environmental cues captured by the smartwatch, such as changes in lighting conditions or object movement. The holographic projection adapts in real-time to changes in the environment to ensure coherence of the holographic image.


**Display of Holographic Projection:**

- Once the holographic interference patterns are calculated, they are displayed using MEMs/DMDs.

- The interference patterns interact with the incoming light to produce a three-dimensional holographic image.

**Components for modulating light:**

- DMD: Cheap, small form factors, low light efficiency (because using the diffraction lights), (binary phase patterns â†’ may need to change the phase retrieval algorithm to take into account) 

- MEMS: Totally different, for projectors and laser scanning systems.  Not holography technology. High light efficiency and also very compact (~2 mm diameter).
