title: 'Face Capture For Hologram'
description: 'We will ask the user to take a picture on their phone on an app which will take into account their proportions and facial features and all that. The app will capture the users 3D model and facial features to make as the hologram.'

**User 3D Capture:**

- Employ techniques like photogrammetry or structured light to reconstruct the users 3D geometry. Will include their proportions, body shape, and facial features to project in the real world

- The app will likely guide the user to capture their entire body from multiple angles to ensure a complete 3D model.

**Facial Capture:**

- Use the app and phone camera to create a detailed 3D model of the users face.

- Incorporate facial tracking capabilities to capture the users facial expressions, lip movements, and other details. There will be sensors on the AR glasses which will detect facial movement and match to the 3D model.

In the example below, we used Blenders F

Transmission:
Once the initial 3D model of the user is captured, it can be transmitted from the smartphone app central server for storage and further processing to the smartwatch 
For real-time holographic projection, the app can stream the users facial tracking data and any body and face movements taken from the AR Glasses
