Headset: 100% easier to make but uncomfortable, not convenient at all to just answer a call and put a huge headset on. Looking into different options, since a minimalistic design of the AR glasses is proven challenging.

Display Technology:
Waveguide-based optics or like OLED microdisplays integrated into the lenses or lens housings
High resolution and wide field of view (ideally close to human vision)
Stereoscopic 3D rendering for accurate depth perception

Computing Platform:
Processors or SoC solutions with dedicated GPU capabilities
Integrated into the frame 

Examples: Qualcomm Snapdragon XR platforms, NVIDIA Jetson modules, or custom ASICs

Sensors and Tracking:
Inertial measurement units and cameras for head tracking and positional tracking
Infrared sensors for gesture recognition and hologram control
6 degrees of freedom for positional tracking and head tracking
Integrated into arms of the glasses

Design:
Lightweight and comfortable materials like carbon fiber
Balanced weight distribution 


The Structure of the Glasses

In the Lenses:
Waveguide-based optics 



Frame:
Front section - Depth cameras or infrared sensors for gesture recognition and hologram control
Temple arms:
 IMUs and cameras 

Top or side sections: 
Wireless connectivity

Temple Arms or Hinges:
Will accommodate the computing platform, including processors, memory modules (RAM and storage) and wireless communication modules 

Battery and Cooling System:
Batteries or wireless power receivers could be integrated into the temple arms or frame
Placed near the computing platform and other heat-generating components

Audio System:
Compact speakers or bone conduction audio drivers could be integrated into the temple arms for audio output

Input Controls:
Physical buttons or touch-sensitive surfaces could be incorporated for user input and control (though not a priority now)
