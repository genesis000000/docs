## A system where:

**User 1** has a smartwatch that captures their environment and projects a holographic representation of **User 2**.

**User 2** can see **User 1's** environment through their AR glasses and control/interact with their own holographic representation in **User 1's** space in the real world.

## Two Devices:

**SmartWatch:**

- Equipped with sensors and cameras to capture the real-life environment.

- Act as a secondary input device that scans the environment and sends data to the AR glasses and central AR system.

**AR Glasses/Headset:**

- Function as the primary display for what the watch captures.

- Connect to the central AR system to receive holographic content and synchronization data.

- Incorporate sensors for tracking the user's movements.

## Holographic Interference Patterns

The holographic projection process will initiate from the wacth. 

- The Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is employed to calculate the holographic interference patterns based on the received environment data. The algorithm repeatedly adjusts the phase distribution on the MEMs within the AR glasses to match the intensity distribution in the image planes.

    This algorithm decomposes a holographic image into its spatial frequency components. The interference pattern required to reconstruct the image is then calculated based on these frequency components.

    This is an iterative algorithm, commonly used for phase retrieval and itâ€™s pretty fast too.
