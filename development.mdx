## A system where:

**User 1** has a smartwatch that captures their environment and projects a holographic representation of **User 2**.

**User 2** can see **User 1's** environment through their AR glasses and control/interact with their own holographic representation in **User 1's** space in the real world.

## Two Devices:

**SmartWatch:**

- Equipped with sensors and cameras to capture the real-life environment.

- Act as a secondary input device that scans the environment and sends data to the AR glasses and central AR system.

**AR Glasses/Headset:**

- Function as the primary display for what the watch captures.

- Connect to the central AR system to receive holographic content and synchronization data.

- Incorporate sensors for tracking the user's movements.

## Holographic Interference Patterns

The holographic projection process will initiate from the wacth. 

- The Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is employed to calculate the holographic interference patterns based on the received environment data. The algorithm repeatedly adjusts the phase distribution on the MEMs within the AR glasses to match the intensity distribution in the image planes.

    This algorithm decomposes a holographic image into its spatial frequency components. The interference pattern required to reconstruct the image is then calculated based on these frequency components.

    This is an iterative algorithm, commonly used for phase retrieval and it’s pretty fast too.

## Real-time Adjustment Based on Environmental 

Whatever algorithm we use takes into account environmental cues captured by the smartwatch, such as changes in lighting conditions or object movement. The holographic projection adapts in real-time to changes in the environment to ensure coherence of the holographic image.

**Display of Holographic Projection:**

- Once the holographic interference patterns are calculated, they are displayed on the SLM (edit: changed to MEMs).

- The interference patterns interact with the incoming light to produce a three-dimensional holographic image

**Components for modulating light:**

- Phase-only SLM: Expensive, accurate modulators (grayscale phase patterns), bulky.

- DMD: Cheap, small form factors, low light efficiency (because using the diffraction lights), (binary phase patterns → may need to change the phase retrieval algorithm to take into account) 

- MEMS: Totally different, for projectors and laser scanning systems.  Not holography technology. High light efficiency and also very compact (~2 mm diameter).
